    "**Business Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer technology companies such as Apple and Google receive a high volume of public feedback about their products on social media platforms, particularly Twitter. Customers frequently use Twitter to share opinions, report issues, and react to product updates in real time. While this feedback is valuable for understanding public perception, the sheer volume and speed of incoming data make manual monitoring impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brand and product insights teams rely on timely information to identify emerging customer concerns, assess overall sentiment trends, and protect brand reputation. Without automated tools, negative sentiment can go unnoticed until it escalates into larger public relations or customer satisfaction issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The company currently lacks an efficient, scalable method to automatically identify whether tweets directed at its brands or products express positive or negative sentiment. As a result, potentially critical negative feedback may be missed or identified too late, limiting the company’s ability to respond proactively to customer concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The informal and noisy nature of Twitter data—including slang, abbreviations, sarcasm, and short text length—further complicates manual analysis and traditional rule-based approaches, making automated sentiment classification a challenging but necessary solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can automatically classify the sentiment of tweets directed at brands and products. The initial focus is on distinguishing negative sentiment from positive sentiment, as early detection of negative feedback is most valuable for brand monitoring and issue escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance will be evaluated using metrics aligned with this objective, with particular emphasis on correctly identifying negative sentiment. In addition to predictive performance, the project aims to provide interpretable model outputs that help stakeholders understand why a tweet is classified as negative or positive, supporting trust and practical adoption of the system."

    "**Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the Judge Emotion About Brands and Products dataset, a crowdsourced collection of Twitter posts labeled for sentiment toward brands and products. The dataset contains 9,093 tweet entries, each represented by three text-based columns. The data was labeled by human annotators to indicate whether a tweet expresses emotion toward a brand or product and, if so, the target of that emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is relatively small in size (approximately 1.2 MB), making it suitable for rapid experimentation and model iteration, while still capturing the challenges of real-world social media text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure and Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *tweet_text*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains the raw text of each tweet. This is the primary feature used for modeling. One entry is missing, indicating minimal but non-zero missing data in the text field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicates the specific brand or product that the expressed emotion is directed toward. This column contains a large number of missing values (approximately 64%), reflecting that many tweets either do not clearly target a specific brand/product or that annotators could not confidently identify the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicates whether the tweet expresses an emotion toward a brand or product and implicitly captures sentiment polarity. This column is fully populated and serves as the primary source for deriving sentiment labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "All columns are stored as text (object dtype), which is expected given the nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality and Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several data quality challenges are present:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Missing values:*\n",
    "- While tweet_text is nearly complete, the emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at column contains substantial missing data. This limits its usefulness for modeling and motivates excluding entity-level analysis from the project scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Noisy text:*\n",
    "- Tweets are short, informal, and often include slang, abbreviations, hashtags, user mentions, URLs, and emojis. These characteristics increase sparsity and variability in the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ambiguous sentiment:*\n",
    "- Some tweets express weak, mixed, or unclear sentiment, making sentiment classification inherently subjective despite human annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Class imbalance:*\n",
    "- Tweets with no expressed emotion are expected to be more common than clearly positive or negative tweets, which has implications for model evaluation and metric selection."
