    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "## 1.1 Business Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology market, consumer perception plays a critical role in shaping the success of products and brands. Technology companies such as Apple and Google continuously release new products and services, and public opinion about these offerings spreads quickly through social media platforms like Twitter. Users frequently share feedback, complaints, praise, and comparisons in real time, creating a large volume of unstructured text data that reflects customer sentiment.\n",
    "Manually analyzing thousands of Tweets to understand public opinion is time-consuming and inefficient. As a result, organizations increasingly rely on data-driven approaches to extract meaningful insights from social media data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques make it possible to automatically analyze and classify textual content, allowing businesses to better understand how consumers feel about their products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying Tweets related to Apple and Google products as positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing over 9,000 human-labeled Tweets provided by CrowdFlower, this project demonstrates how NLP models can be used as a proof of concept to capture and quantify public sentiment expressed on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stakeholders for this model include product managers, marketing teams, brand analysts, and business strategists within technology companies. Such a model can help organizations monitor brand perception, evaluate customer reactions to product launches, identify common sources of dissatisfaction, and track sentiment trends over time. Additionally, researchers and data scientists can use this approach to explore consumer behavior and improve decision-making processes through real-time sentiment monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project falls within the domains of business analytics, marketing intelligence, and data science, with a focus on applying NLP techniques to real-world social media data. The motivation behind this work is to demonstrate how sentiment analysis can support strategic business decisions by transforming unstructured text data into actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology companies and brand analysts often rely on manual review, surveys, and expert judgment to assess public opinion about their products and services. While these approaches provide valuable insights, they are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale in environments where consumer feedback is generated continuously and at high volume, such as on social media platforms. As a result, important trends in customer sentiment—both positive and negative—may be overlooked or identified too late to inform timely business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers frequently express their opinions about Apple and Google products on Twitter using informal language, abbreviations, emojis, and sarcasm, making it challenging to interpret sentiment accurately through traditional analytical methods. The unstructured nature of social media text further complicates consistent and objective sentiment assessment, especially when thousands of Tweets must be analyzed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proposes the development of an NLP-based sentiment classification model that analyzes Tweet content and categorizes sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is designed to complement, rather than replace, human analysis by providing an automated, scalable tool for understanding public perception. Business stakeholders such as marketing teams, product managers, and brand analysts can use this model to support decision-making, monitor brand reputation, and identify emerging issues or opportunities in near real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is intended as a decision-support tool and should be used alongside domain expertise and contextual knowledge. While it enables efficient large-scale sentiment analysis, human interpretation remains essential to account for nuances such as sarcasm and evolving language trends. By combining automated NLP techniques with expert oversight, this project aims to improve the efficiency, consistency, and accessibility of sentiment analysis in a business context.\n",
